# About

R translation of the computational model written in MATLAB by John S. Chen for *The Impact of Learning and Overconfidence on Entrepreneurial Entry and Exit* (https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2018.1225), based on the formal model originally developed by Ryan and Lippman (2003) (https://doi.org/10.1017/S0269964803174013).

For basic use, set parameter values in run_set_params.R and run.
